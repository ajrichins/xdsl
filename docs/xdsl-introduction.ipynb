    "# Why xDSL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programming languages are rather far removed from Assembly code. As a result, translating a language directly into Assembly is both difficult (easy to make mistakes) and inefficient (generated Assembly code is slow!). Therefore, most compilers goes through many intermediate representations / languages (IRs), which represents different layers of abstractions, to provide an efficient translation down to Assembly code - which is also feasible for compiler engineers to write. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although an effective approach, over the years it has become apparent that many compilers are repeatedly defining similar intermediate languages. Given the separate architecture of different compilers, it has been quite difficult to reuse code between architectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previous projects such as LLVM has provided a common abstraction layer for different compilers to reuse - however this is only one layer, and compilers of different domains are still having to repeat significant amounts of work to reach the LLVM level. \n",
    "\n",
    "LLVM is also not necessarily the ideal layer to perform optimisations on - thus many compilers will also implement their own implementations on custom IRs before they reach LLVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "MLIR, and its Python parallel, xDSL, are frameworks to make it easy to:\n",
    "1. Define custom abstraction layers for compilers\n",
    "2. Reuse abstractions from other compilers\n",
    "3. Encode domain-specific knowledge (i.e. optimisations) within these abstraction layers\n",

This is a common restriction used within compilers, as it enables many compiler optimisations to be performed.\n",

    "The kind of programming languages xDSL defines all have the $\\textit{static single assignment}$ (SSA) property. It is a property on variables that means they can be assigned a value only once, and once assigned a value, they cannot be modified. This is a common restriction used within compilers, as it enables many compiler optimisations to be performed."
